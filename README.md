# Script-Screen-er-Decision-Tree
This is a simple ai decision tree that a partner and I set up about a year and a half ago. The point is to determine what genre a movie script belongs to souly based upon word choice and frequencey of those choices. There are test cases of known scripts, about 10 per genre, that we utilize as the bases for our program. 13 keywords are found to have the most diverse entropy gain between these genres from the test cases. From there, the discrete values of the frequency of the words are gathered, and a desicion tree is constructed based on our known values. From there, the program will attempt to assign a genre to the unknown movie scripts. It's not the most acurate, however for a short project I find it rather impressive.
